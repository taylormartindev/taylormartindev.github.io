      <title>Beginning Webdev in 2025</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s so many things that I wish I would have started sooner. The compounding impacts of picking up skills early can be difficult to grasp until later in life. Learning how to cook a decent meal before my 30s would have compounded into a much broader range of culinary interests. Figuring out how to break through social anxiety and make more friends in my early 20&amp;rsquo;s would have led to me having so many more interesting stories an exchanges in the places I&amp;rsquo;ve lived. Blogging, and, by extension, web development seems like one of those massive missed opportunities to have started far earlier in life. There&amp;rsquo;s so much useful routine in tracking your progress through a project, and there&amp;rsquo;s so much freedom in having just a little corner of the internet to post your random ideas and journeys to be able to show to anyone at any time, or just to have a little diary for yourself to reflect back on. That&amp;rsquo;s my intent with this little corner here, just a simple way for me to work on projects and keep track of what I&amp;rsquo;ve had to learn along the way. That way in a another 10 years, I won&amp;rsquo;t have to think about what the compounding impacts of this journey could have been; I&amp;rsquo;ll get to know them first hand.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
