Hello there! My name is Taylor Martin. I'm interested in all things that think, from computers, to people/animals, to \<insert 3rd category when discovered\>. 

I have worked in various Information Technology fields since 2010. Knowledge management, IT management, logistics tracking, boundary protection, penetration testing, etc. I'm also a big gamer, rock climber, mountain biker, imrov actor, joke teller, and whatever else is my hyper fixation for the week. 

But for the most part I just like to learn more about how to make cool stuff do fun things, and share that journey with others.
