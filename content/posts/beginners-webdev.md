There's so many things that I wish I would have started sooner. The compounding impacts of picking up skills early can be difficult to grasp until later in life. Learning how to cook a decent meal before my 30s would have compounded into a much broader range of culinary interests. Figuring out how to break through social anxiety and make more friends in my early 20's would have led to me having so many more interesting stories an exchanges in the places I've lived. Blogging, and, by extension, web development seems like one of those massive missed opportunities to have started far earlier in life. There's so much useful routine in tracking your progress through a project, and there's so much freedom in having just a little corner of the internet to post your random ideas and journeys to be able to show to anyone at any time, or just to have a little diary for yourself to reflect back on. That's my intent with this little corner here, just a simple way for me to work on projects and keep track of what I've had to learn along the way. That way in a another 10 years, I won't have to think about what the compounding impacts of this journey could have been; I'll get to know them first hand.
